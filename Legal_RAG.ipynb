       "\n",
       "The court ultimately ruled in favor of the school, stating that all three conditions – permanent construction, \"acting upon the license,\" and incurred expenses – were met, making the license irrevocable. The court emphasized that allowing someone to build on land while granting a license doesn’t automatically create a right to revoke it later. \n",

They hadn’t produced evidence demonstrating that the construction and expenses were “acting upon the license” – a crucial element required to make the license irrevocable. The court emphasized that the pleadings need not mirror the exact wording of the statute and focused on the substance of the case.  The judges agreed that the respondents’ pleadings were insufficient to support their claim.\n",

       "*   **Substance Over Form:** The court emphasizes that the focus should be on the *substance* of the pleadings and the issues raised, rather than strictly adhering to the form of the pleadings.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Knowledge of the Issue:** A crucial factor is whether the parties *knew* the issue was being contested. If both parties were aware of a particular matter and evidence was presented about it, a party can rely on it even if it wasn't explicitly pleaded.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Evidence is Key:**  If evidence is presented regarding a matter, a party can invoke it, regardless of whether it was specifically pleaded. The plaintiff did this by producing the donor in evidence to support his claim of an irrevocable license.\n",

       "*   **Bhagwati Prasad Case Analogy:** The court refers to the *Bhagwati Prasad v. Shri Chandramaul* case, which provides a similar principle – a plea isn’t denied simply because it wasn't expressly made if the issue was known and evidence was presented.\n",
