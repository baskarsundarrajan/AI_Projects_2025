Grow To Glow ðŸŒ¾ | AI_Projects_2025
Project Overview
Grow To Glow is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist farmers and nutrition enthusiasts in Goa. It provides seasonal advice, cultivation tips, and dietary suggestions based on local coastal and saline conditions. Powered by a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3.3 model, this system ensures accurate, timely, and expert recommendations.

The backend uses FastAPI, FAISS for vector search, and HuggingFace sentence-transformers for embeddings.
